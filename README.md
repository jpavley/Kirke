# Kirke
Medication management iOS app

# About
Kirke (more commonly spelled Circe) is the Greek Godess of pharmika, magic based on herbs, potions, and formulas and thus a fine muse for an app that managages our medications. More people than ever, like me, are using drug-based therapies to treat chronic and acute illnesses. We have to manage all kinds of complications with our medications: over-the-counter and prescription, generics and branded, home delivery and local pharmacy, pricing and discounts, refills, re-authorization, and pre-authorization, tracking and dosing, effectiveness and side-effects.

It's a bit of a logistical nightmare as today we need to be our own health advocates, do our own research, argue with our health insurance providers, and still manage to remember if we took our pills.

Obviously a great job for an app! And there are many "pill minders" in the App Store. They tend to do about 50% of the job, but they do it pretty well. The current apps are good for tracking doses and refills. But they are missing procurement (how the medicine is obtained), cost management, and tracking of possitive and negative effects. Many feature innovative user experiences, which unfortunately might be hard to older users to manage. Finally, none, as far as I can tell, are open sourced.

The goal of Kirke is to use the standard iOS user experience to not only track dosing and refills, but cost and effects as well. The idea is that you can take Kirke to your doctor and have a great discusison about cost benefits, alternitives, and effect of your medications on your health.
