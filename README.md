Medication management iOS app

# About
Kirke is the Greek Godess of pharmika, magic based on herbs, potions, and formulas and thus a fine muse for an app that managages our medications. More people than ever, like me, are using drug-based therapies to treat chronic and acute illnesses. We have to manage all kinds of complications with our medications: over-the-counter and prescription, generics and branded, home delivery and local pharmacy, pricing and discounts, refills, re-authorization, and pre-authorization, tracking and dosing, effectiveness and side-effects.

It's a bit of a logistical nightmare as today we need to be our own health advocates, do our own research, argue with our health insurance providers, and still manage to remember if we took our pills.

Obviously a great job for an app! And there are many "pill minders" in the App Store. My current favorite is Round. It does about 50% of the job, but it does it -really- pretty well.
